Working:

* Command line options are parsed correctly, and checking is done to see if the
  input file exists. 
* Correct status codes will be returned if the file doesn't exist, or if improper
  flags are passed to the program.
* ./huff -t <inputfile> will print out a frequency table (*not* a translation file
  like it should) if the input file is not a huff file, so huff file validation
  is also working.
