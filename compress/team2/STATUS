Working:

* Command line options are parsed correctly, and checking is done to see if the
  input file exists. 
* Correct status codes will be returned if the file doesn't exist, or if improper
  flags are passed to the program.
* ./huff -t <inputfile> will correctly generate and print a translation table 
  if the file is not a valid .huff file, and will print the translation table
  included in a compressed file if the file is a valid .huff file.
* ./huff -c <inputfile> will correctly compress the given input file and write
  the compressed file to <inputfile>.huff. Error checking is done on all writes
  and reads.
* ./huff -d <inputfile>.huff will correctly decompress a compressed huff file
  to the original file. Checks are made to ensure that <inputfile>.huff is actually
  a compressed file.
* The program has no memory leaks.
