I wasn't able to work on this project since Tusday because of obligations to other classes. I did realize 
a problem with my implementation of the Huffman tree however. I am internally storing Huffman bits as 
chars. It was easier to write the logic this way because I didn't have to worry about bit shifting, but 
it is a huge waste of memory. It makes Andres's job harder too because he is going to be reading/writing 
bit streams and having to convert them to/from chars. I don't think it will be too hard to change my 
current implementation to use bits instead of bytes. Let me know what you guys think. I am happy to change 
my current implementation. I am curious if a byte based implementation would be faster considering memory 
is byte based and there wouldn't be any bit shifting overhead in the compressing/decompressing logic. I 
wanted to consult with you dudes before I coded any further.
