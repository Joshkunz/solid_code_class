There is a bug when calling build_tree_tbl while decompressing. The huffman table is being read correctly from a compressed huff file, but the call to build_tree_tbl creates a null tree.

I am not getting that error? Also it seems you are writing bytes and not bits to a compressed file in the huffman code section.
