There is a bug when calling build_tree_tbl while decompressing. The huffman table is being read correctly from a compressed huff file, but the call to build_tree_tbl creates a null tree. <-- Can you just dump the table to stdout? I think that would be faster.

It seems you are writing bits backwards in huff_io.c.
I commited some changes that make everything work except using -t on a huff file.
