To use the decoding function, first call build_tree_tbl with a huffman table. The memory needed for the 
huff table is no longer needed after this point because all data is saved in the tree. Then, to decode 
bit vectors from the file, call the get_char function. We talked about that function in class, it will 
return when a character is found. Be sure to call free_huff_tree() to free all allocated memory in the 
tree before the program exits.

To use the encoding function, call gen_tree_frq with a sorted array of char frequencies. Then you can 
use the get_code function to get the corresponding huffman code for a given character. Also call 
free_huff_tree before exiting program.
